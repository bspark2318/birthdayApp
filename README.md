## Application Detail

### Introduction 
HBD App, or a simple Happy Birthday App, is developed using SwiftUI for the front-end
and Python Flask for the backend. The front-end is composed of three tab views, each with a
different functionality. The backend is split into three sections of API, tasks, and analytics. This
app aims to facilitate tracking birthdays easier for people without having to clutter their
calendars. It sends them an email notification every Monday at 9AM (CT) of upcoming
birthdays in that week and aggregates the upcoming birthdays in a summary view for easy
viewing. The calendar tab is also there to help people get quickly contextualized, and adding and
deleting birthday has never been easier!
